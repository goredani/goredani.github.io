                        <br>
                        Some of our features were incomplete and we had to rush to make it to market in time.

                    <span>Conclusion</span>
                        <br>
                        Most of our users were not aware of the metrics and how we are calculating them. (eg. performance) We had to find a more understandable way to provide this information to them.
