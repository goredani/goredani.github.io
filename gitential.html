            <p>
              An effective analytical service offers users a comprehensive
              overview of their projects while also providing the option to
              access detailed information when desired. To achieve this balance,
              we have designed our dashboard to display only essential
              information and highlight key insights we deem most valuable.
            </p>
            <p>
              For users who wish to delve deeper into their projects and the
              associated developers, the system is equipped to provide detailed
              data, advanced filtering options, and export functionalities.
              Additionally, our service includes customizable options, allowing
              users to tailor the dashboard and reports to their specific needs,
              ensuring a personalized and efficient analytical experience.

            <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
            <p>
              One of the main challenges I faced was deciding how to present
              specific types of data and information. I had to consider the
              capabilities of our system, the functionalities offered by our
              data visualization framework, and whether the chosen
              visualizations effectively communicated the necessary insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              To enhance user experience further, I incorporated customizable
              options, allowing users to add more charts with custom settings.
              This flexibility empowers users to personalize their dashboards,
              tailoring the experience to their individual preferences.

            <h3>Onboarding</h3>
            <p>
              In response to user feedback, we identified the onboarding phase
              as one of the most challenging aspects, particularly when users
              needed to connect their repositories to our service. This process
              was complicated by varying requirements and security
              configurations across different services.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address this challenge, our objective was to simplify the
              entire onboarding process. By minimizing the number of required
              steps and providing helpful guidance through helper texts, we
              aimed to decrease churn rates.

            <h3>What have I learned?</h3>
            <p>
              It's important to listen the user feedbacks properly. Not just
              what UX problems do they have while using the site but
              fundamentally, what do they question or they don't understand
              about your product. It would have been better if we would
              communicate how do we mean under developer productivity and how do
              we measure it.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is more like a product issue, but it's better to find a
              problem that needs to be solved first, rather than create a
              solution and trying to find the problem that it can solve later
              on.
