                    Lensa empowering job seekers to make their best career decisions by building data-driven intelligence that supports their goals, skills, and needs. As a UX/UI designer at Lensa, my job was to design new features, create and maintain the design system.

                <h2>Admin interface for partners</h2>
                <p>
                    <span>Problem</span>
                    <br>
                    Professional partners can buy leads from Lensa to further process them. Partners were managing these leads through email with account managers, which was a bit slow and inconvenient.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Create an admin interface where partners could manage their feeds</li>
                        <li>Create an admin interface where partners could send quotes to our account managers</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </p>

                    <span>Constraints</span>
                    <br>
                    Our API was not 100% complete, so some of the features were not possible to finish until the first launch.
                </p>

               
                    <p>
                    <span>Conclusion</span>
                        <br>
                        Partners could manage their feeds through the admin interface which drastically freed up time for the account managers. The feature list were extended later on.

                <p>
                    <span>Problem</span>
                    <br>
                    Our onboarding flow was outdated regarding functionalities and design. We wanted to align it with our new brand and provide a better UX to achieve higher conversion rates throughout the onboarding flow.  
                </p>

                        <li>Align it with the new brand and design system</li>
                        <li>Conduct A/B tests and iterate on the designs</li>

                    <br>
                    Multiple steps can affect the conversion rate negatively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Conclusion</span>
                    <br>
                    The first version performed worse than the older version of the onboarding. By adjusting content ratio, contrast, etc. we managed to reach a higher conversion rate than ever before.

                    <span>Problem</span>
                    <br>
                    Job seekers had to browse elsewhere if they wanted to find out more about a given company. By providing information about the companies we could increase their time on the site and prevent them from browsing away.

                    <span>Constraints</span>
                    <br>
                    Some of our company information was incomplete. We had to solve that the page would provide meaningful information from minimal data.
                </p>

                        As we received more information about the companies, we could add more features and help our users make better decisions.
