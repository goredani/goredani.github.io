                    <br>
                    Our onboarding flow is old, outdated and not in sync with the companyâ€™snew brand.

                    <br>
                    The new versions were performed lower than the older version by 2-3%.
Later on we managed to optimize the screens and improved the conversion rate compared to the original versions.

                    <span>Problem</span>
                    <br>
                    Job seekers had to browse elsewhere if they wanted to find out more
about a given company. By providing info about the company we could 
increase their time on the site.

                        <br>
                        The dataset was a bit limited, later on we had more data to display,had to change the layout.
Data tables on mobile are challenging.
