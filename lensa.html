            <h3>Company pages</h3>
            <p>
              Keeping visitors on the site is essential for maximizing conversions. By providing detailed information about companies on the Lensa site, we increased the time users spend on our website and enhanced their trust in our platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve this, we gathered comprehensive information about companies posting job ads and created dedicated company pages accessible from every relevant job ad. These pages feature a responsive layout, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

            <h3>Onboarding on mobile</h3>
            <p>
              The onboarding phase is one of the most important parts of our user journey. At Lensa, it was crucial to keep users engaged in the onboarding flow, gather as much information as possible, and ensure they completed the registration process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mobile interface was outdated in both design and functionality, so we decided to redesign the entire onboarding flow. We optimized the responsive layout, updated the UI, and tested various versions through A/B tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              These changes significantly increased our overall conversion rates, improving both the completion ratio and the amount of information users shared with us.

            <h3>Admin interface for our partners</h3>
            <p>
              As the number of our partners increased, it became increasingly difficult to handle their requests efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through interviews with internal stakeholders and Product Owners, we developed an admin interface that allows our partners to create and download customized job feeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              This admin interface significantly reduced the workload on our support team and greatly improved the experience for our partners.
