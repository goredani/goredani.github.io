This is the final project for the Javascript & The DOM Section for my Udacity Nanodegree.

The simple landing page has a header for navigation and 4 sections whith an image and some text.

By clicking on the navigational links we immediately scroll to the appropriate section.
We highlight the appropriate link in the header based on which section is active for the user.

The CSS styles can be found in the css folder.
The app.js with the javascript can be found in the js folder.
The related images can be found in the images folder.
