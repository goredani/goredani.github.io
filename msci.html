                    <span>Problem</span>
                    <br>
                    Generating charts to the widgets are too complex and not really well designed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Tasks</span>
                    <br>
                    Redesign the chart designer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Constraints</span>
                    <br>
                    Technical constraints, cant rewrite the underlying chart engine.

                    <span>Conclusion</span>
                        <br>
                        Partners could manage their feeds through the admin interface which drastically freed up time for the account managers.
