                    <span>Problem</span>
                    <br>
                    The flow of creating new charts was a bit too complicated for our users. We wanted to create a more seamless experience so our users could create their reports faster in the future.

                    <span>Tasks</span>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Redesign the flow of the chart creator.</li>
                        <li>Create a new UI for it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Constraints</span>
                    <br>
                    We had to take into account that we couldn't change the underlying chart render engine.

                        <br>
                        We managed to decrease the time that our users had to spend on creating new widget.
