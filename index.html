          <p class="description">
            Instead of dividing the designer and front-end teams, we approached
            a new way of at Lensa. By integrating front-end developers (UX
            engineers, as we called ourselves) into the design team we improved
            the efficiency of designer-developer communication and made sure
            that the developed components were the same as the designers
            imagined them in our design system.
