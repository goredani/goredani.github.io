                <h2>The Big Score: The Billion-Dollar Story of Silicon Valley</h2>
                <h4>Michael S. Malone</h4>
                <p>Silicon Valley is home to many of technology’s key players, but its origins are much humbler––and The Big Score chronicles how it began. One of the first reporters on the tech industry beat, Michael S. Malone recounts the feverish efforts of young technologists and entrepreneurs to build something that would change the world. Starting with the birth of Hewlett-Packard in the 1930s, Malone illustrates how decades of technological innovation, driven by the need for better hardware, laid the foundation for the meteoric rise of the Valley in the 1970s. Drawing on unvarnished interviews, he punctuates this history with incisive profiles of early luminaries, including William Shockley and Steve Jobs, when they were struggling entrepreneurs. With stories of ingenuity and individual sacrifice at its core, The Big Score is an indelible portrait of the high-agency spirit of early Silicon Valley.</p>

                <h2>Scientific Freedom: The Elixir of Civilization</h2>
                <h4>Donald W. Braben</h4>
                <p>So rich was the scientific harvest of the early 20th century that it transformed entire industries and economies. But in the 1970s, increases in public funding for scientific research brought demands that spending be justified; a system of peer review that selected only the research proposals promising the greatest returns; and a push for endless short-term miracles instead of in-depth, boundary-pushing research. In Scientific Freedom, first published in 2008, Donald W. Braben presents a revolutionary and tested framework to find and support cutting-edge, much-needed scientific innovation. Support for such research can be low risk and offer rich rewards, Braben argues, but it requires rethinking the processes used to discover and sponsor scientists with groundbreaking ideas - and the giving those innovators the freedom of explore.</p>

                <h2>Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</h2>
                <h4>Nadia Eghbal</h4>
                <p>Open source software has undergone a significant shift over the past 20 years. Today, often unseen solo operators maintain code used by millions. In Working in Public, Nadia Eghbal takes an inside look at modern open source software development and its evolution over the last two decades—and its ramifications for an internet reorienting itself around individual creators. She examines GitHub as a platform; the structures, roles, incentives, and relationships of open source projects; and their heretofore unexplored maintenance, via the work that software requires of its creators and the costs of production that must be maintained. Open source offers us a model through which to understand the challenges faced by online creators on all platforms.

                </h2>
                <h4>Richard Hamming</h4>
                <p>Richard Hamming inspired a generation of engineers, scientists, and researchers in 1986 with "You and Your Research"—an exhortation to seek out important problems, establish comfort with ambiguity, and be unapologetic in the pursuit of excellence. The Art of Doing Science and Engineering is the full expression of what "You and Your Research" outlined. It's a book about thinking; more specifically, a style of thinking by which great ideas are conceived. Adapted from a course that Hamming taught at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and with a new foreword by Bret Victor, The Art of Doing Science and Engineering is a reminder that a childlike capacity for learning and creativity are accessible to everyone.
