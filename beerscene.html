                    BeerScene was born after a Startup Weekend in Copenhagen. Our goal was to show the best beers to beer enthusiasts in the town so they could find the best place to go.

                        <br>
                        We released the MVP version which received a good feedback from the beer enthusiast community in Copenhagen. However the app was not scalable and later on we lost access for certain APIs which were vital to our service.
