It allows you to create, personalize and launch popups, sidebars, notification bars and fullscreens without coding. As a product designer, I was responsible for designing the new features and maintain, update the design system.

                <h2>Coupon manager with Shopify</h2>
                <p>
                    <span>Problem</span>
                    <br>
                    Most of our clients were using Shopify for their webshops. They already had coupon codes in their account and we wanted to sync those coupon codes with Optimonk for a better user experience and a faster workflow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Tasks</span>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enable coupon syncing with Shopify</li>
                        <li>Update the editor UI</li>
                        <li>Handle all of the edge cases</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </p>

                    <span>Constraints</span>
                        <br>
                        We had to consider that Shopify provided limited API functionalities.

                    <span>Conclusion</span>
                        <br>
                        Due to the constraints we had to drop some functionalities, however we managed 
                        make the coupon code sync as pleasant as possible.

                <h2>Visitor Property segmentation tool</h2>
                <p>
                    <span>Problem</span>
                    <br>
                    Some of our bigger clients demanded more sophisticated segmentation options in order to target their campaigns more precisely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Solution</span>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide custom segmentation options</li>
                        <li>Make it possible to combine (AND/OR) these segmentation rules</li>
                    </ul>
                   
                </p>

                    <span>Conclusion</span>
                        <br>
                        After some iterations, we managed to deliver a simple, yet scalable rule editor, where smaller and bigger clients could edit their segmentation rules.
