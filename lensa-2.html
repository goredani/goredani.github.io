                <p class="description">
                    Instead of dividing the designer and front-end teams, we approached
            a new way of at Lensa. By integrating front-end developers (UX
            engineers, as we called ourselves) into the design team we improved
            the efficiency of designer-developer communication and made sure
            that the developed components were the same as the designers
            imagined them in our design system.

                <ul>
                    <li>There's usually a communication gap between designers and developers</li>
                    <li>Developers have no resources for developing the component system</li>
                    <li>Different javascript frameworks have different component requirements</li>
                    <li>Developers are not aware of the existing components</li>

                        <li>We used the Lit web component framework to create our web components</li>
                        <li>We used Storybook to test and communicate the components to the other teams (React and Svelte teams)</li>
                        <li>We also implemented Tailwind to speed up our development process</li>
